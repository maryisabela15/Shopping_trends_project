# Data cleaning with PostgreSQL

This repository shows the [Shopping_trends_project](https://github.com/maryisabela15/Shopping_trends_project/blob/main/shopping_trends.csv).

* The data for this project is [Nashville Housing Data for Data Cleaning - Sheet1.csv](https://github.com/maryisabela15/SQL_Data_Analysis/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning%20-%20Sheet1.csv) and was taken from Alex The Analyst's YouTube channel as part of his SQL project series. The data shows information about the housing in Nashville, such as price, number of rooms, location, etc.
* The project focused on creating a table, importing data into the table, and performing data cleansing and transformation on the dataset using PostgreSQL.
